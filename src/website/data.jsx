Labore dolor vero voluptatem magnam, perspiciatis, porro saepe maxime, laboriosam cum nihil debitis dicta deserunt eius.
    \n ### Step - 2 
    \n Combine the olive oil, cumin, cinnamon, allspice, cardamom, turmeric, garlic, 2 teaspoons salt and a generous amount of pepper in a large bowl. Add the chicken and onions and toss to coat evenly. Spread in a single layer on a sheet pan, making sure the pieces are not overlapping. Bake until the chicken is cooked through and the onions are slightly caramelized, about 15 minutes.  
    \n ### Step - 3
    \n Meanwhile, mix the yogurt, lemon juice and a generous amount of pepper in a medium bowl until smooth. Warm the pitas in the microwave on a microwave-safe plate, 30 seconds to 1 minute.  
    \n ### Step - 4 
    \n Spread the yogurt sauce on top of the pitas and spoon the chicken and onions over the sauce. Top with the pickles, tomatoes and shredded lettuce.

Place the potatoes on the other side of the baking sheet, leaving an empty space in the center for the broccoli. Drizzle the potatoes with 1 tablespoon of of the olive oil, and sprinkle with salt and pepper, tossing to evenly coat. Bake until the potatoes begin to soften and the drumsticks begin to cook and caramelize, 20 minutes.

    \n ### Step - 2 

    \n Remove the baking sheet from the oven and put the broccoli in the center. Drizzle the broccoli with the remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil, and lightly sprinkle with salt and pepper, tossing with tongs to evenly coat. Brush the drumsticks with the teriyaki glaze on all sides.
 
    \n ### Step - 3
    \n Return the baking sheet to the oven and roast until the broccoli and potatoes are tender and charred in spots and the drumsticks are completely cooked through and read an internal temperature of 160 degrees F, 20 to 25 minutes more. Divide chicken and vegetables between two plates and serve.

    \n ### Step - 3
    \n Light a grill to high heat.

    \n ### Step - 4
    \n Strain the shrimp from the marinade and season them with salt and black pepper, to taste. Grill the shrimp on both sides until they are slightly charred and just cooked through, about 2 minutes per side (see Cook's Note). Transfer the shrimp to a plate.

    \n ### Step - 5
    \n Melt the butter in a large saute pan set over the grates of the grill. Add the lemon zest, lemon juice, tarragon and thyme leaves and cook for 30 seconds. Add the shrimp and cook, tossing once, about 1 minute. Finish with the parsley and adjust the seasonings, if necessary. Transfer the shrimp to a serving platter and garnish with thyme and parsley.

Gently fold the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients with a rubber spatula until the batter just comes together (it's OK if there are lumps). Transfer the batter to the prepared loaf pan and bake until a tester inserted in the center comes out clean, 55 to 60 minutes; tent the loaf with foil if it is browning too quickly. Cool the loaf in the pan on a wire rack for 30 minutes, then lift it from the pan by the parchment overhangs and cool completely on the rack. Store the loaf in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 5 days.
